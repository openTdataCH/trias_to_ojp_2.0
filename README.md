# trias_to_ojp_2.0
Draft of XSLT (and server associcated) to do a trias -> ojp 2.0 transform, which allows clients to use trias and to connect in the background to an OJP 2.0 service.  Currently only a draft for some request parts. PoC

# Supported functionality
If something is missing that you need, then we need to extend the xslt.

# XSLT 1.0
The core are two xslt:
* One transforms trias requests into ojp 2.0 requests: 'trias_to_ojp2.0_request.xslt'
* One transforms ojp 2.0 responses to trias responses: 'trias_to_ojp2.0_response.xlst'

Currently, a first draft of the first xslt is really done

We use mostly subtemplates for common elements and "functions".

# Programs
* server.py: the service
* test_client.py: a simple test client
* test_transform_req.py: the test program for the  the requests TRIAS -> OJP 2.0
* test_transform_resp.py: the test program for a Stop Event Response OJP 2.0 -> TRIAS

All are currently in a PoC state.

# TODO
* Requests: Placeref better
* Responses: Do some of the other services
